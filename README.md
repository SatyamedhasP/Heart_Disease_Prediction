# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients with either diabetes or skin cancer using machine learning algorithms. 
The project utilizes demographic and medical data to identify factors that increase the risk of heart disease in these patients, with the ultimate goal of improving patient care through early intervention and treatment.

### Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of mortality in both the United States and the rest of the globe. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for 655,000 deaths annually. Nearly half of individuals in the United States suffer from cardiovascular disease. It affects both genders. In fact, one in three female deaths is caused by cardiovascular disease. It impacts individuals of various ages, races, and socioeconomic statuses. High levels of blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking and alcohol consumption, an unhealthy diet full of fat, sodium, and sugar, obesity, a family long history of heart illnesses, and chronic diseases are heart disease leading factors. Chronic disease is deemed to be a key driver that accelerates the development of cardiovascular disease. Among these chronic diseases are diabetes and various types of cancer such as skin cancer.
The leading cause of mortality in persons with diabetes is cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for two-thirds of all fatalities in people with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, those with diabetes are twice as likely as those who do not have diabetes to get heart disease or a stroke than those who do not.
The National Cancer Institute reports that certain cancer therapies can harm the heart and circulatory system. Chemotherapy and radiation can induce or exacerbate high blood pressure, abnormal heart rhythms, and heart failure. This is due to the fact that cancer therapies can impact several organs, including the heart.

### Research Question
The purpose of this research is to build a classification model for diabetic and skin cancer patients that helps in precisely determining if a patient has heart disease or not. The research question derived from this objective is:
- Does a chronic disease such as skin cancer and diabetes cause heart disease?
